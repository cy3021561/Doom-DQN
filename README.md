## Overview

This project focuses on training an AI agent to play Doom games using Deep Convolutional Q-Learning (DQN) with Eligibility Trace (N-Step Q-Learning). DQN is a powerful deep reinforcement learning algorithm that combines the benefits of Q-Learning with deep neural networks to achieve impressive results in game environments. By incorporating Eligibility Trace, the AI agent can efficiently update Q-values, leading to enhanced performance in playing Doom games.

## Project Plan

1. **Deep Convolutional Q-Learning:** The project will introduce the concept of Deep Q-Learning, where a deep neural network is used to approximate the Q-function, enabling the AI agent to make informed decisions based on its current state.

2. **Eligibility Trace (N-Step Q-Learning):** Participants will learn about the Eligibility Trace technique, which extends Q-Learning to update Q-values more efficiently by incorporating multiple time steps of experience.

## What I've Learned

Through the development of the Doom AI agent using DQN with Eligibility Trace, participants will gain practical experience and knowledge in the following areas:

1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Students will learn about the principles of deep reinforcement learning and its application in complex game environments like Doom.

2. **DQN Algorithm:** The project will introduce Deep Q-Learning and its integration with deep convolutional neural networks for effective decision-making in the game.

3. **Eligibility Trace (N-Step Q-Learning):** Participants will gain insights into the Eligibility Trace technique, which improves the efficiency of updating Q-values during training.

4. **PyTorch for Deep Learning:** Students will build the AI agent using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning and AI platform.

5. **Reinforcement Learning in Game Environments:** The project showcases the application of deep reinforcement learning in playing Doom games, highlighting the AI agent's learning process and performance.
